The World Government's apprehension and subsequent execution of Roger prompted a global shift. His final words disclosed the existence of One Piece, the greatest treasure in the world. As a result, the Grand Age of Pirates emerged, with swashbucklers yearning for One Piece's vast riches, fame, and the vaunted title of Pirate King. Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old atypical pirate, enters the fray. Unlike the stereotypical marauder—grizzled, wicked, and ruthless—Luffy seeks pure adventure, relishing the prospect of meeting diverse characters, embarking on wild escapades, and ultimately obtaining the promised treasure. Inspired by his childhood idol, Luffy and his team navigate the Grand Line, encountering strange phenomena, unraveling enigmatic puzzles, and battling formidable foes in their quest for One Piece, the most coveted of all treasures.",

Naofumi Iwatani, an enthusiastic otaku, was burdened with the role of being the Shield Hero, equipped with a weak shield.
